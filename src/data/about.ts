I'm a **Data Engineer & ML Engineer** with almost four years of experience crafting robust data pipelines, real-time analytics setups, and AI-driven applications that deliver measurable business impact. My technical expertise spans Python, PySpark, SQL, Apache Spark, and AWS, with deep specialization in ETL/ELT processes, ML model deployment, and intuitive data visualizations. I've processed over 15TB of daily data, boosted fraud detection accuracy by 30%, and slashed model deployment times by 40% through smart automation - proving that efficient data flows can transform business operations.

When I'm not solving complex data challenges or optimizing data pipelines, you'll find me chasing epic sunsets by the lakes with my camera in hand, exploring hiking trails, or indulging my inner coffee connoisseur with a perfectly crafted pour-over. I believe that the best brainstorming sessions happen over a fresh cup of coffee, and that the intersection of technology and creativity is where innovation truly thrives.

I'm passionate about continuous learning and always excited to discuss AI ethics, swap playlist recommendations, or dive into the latest developments in data engineering. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, potential collaborator, or just someone who appreciates good vibes, I'd love to connect and explore how we can push the boundaries of what's possible with data.
