},
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Start with contact info** - This is the easiest to customize
2. **Add your work experience** - Most important for your resume
3. **Update the about page** - Make it personal and engaging
4. **Add your projects** - Showcase your best work
5. **Customize skills** - Highlight your technical expertise
6. **Add your photo** - Make it personal

## üí° Tips

- **Be specific**: Instead of "Built websites," say "Built responsive e-commerce site using React"
- **Use metrics**: "Improved performance by 50%" is better than "Improved performance"
- **Keep it current**: Update regularly with new projects and experiences
- **Be authentic**: Let your personality shine through in the about section

## üîß Testing Your Changes

After making changes, your development server will automatically reload. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your updates!
